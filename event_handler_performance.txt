performance data collected:


FOR COMPILATION WITH -Os
========================

processing 20 events of 0100..0104 (which have 8 matches in the registry)
~40 msec  (37-40 msec)
for 100:
174 or 212 msec (there is probably a rounding problem here, freertos cannot really measure sub-millisecond time)


processing 20 events that have zero matches
~2 msec (0-3 msec)
for 100 irrelevant events: 4-10 msec


processing events with one match in the registry:
100-140 msec for 100 events.
