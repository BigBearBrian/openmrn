openmrn/src/DCC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This directory contains an optional module that most OpenMRN application will
not need to include. The module defines some classes for representing DCC
packets as well as some common utilities for generating packets.

While the library is named after DCC, there may be support for other protocols
on the track as well, such as Marklin-Motorola.

These libraries can be helpful for applications implementing a command station,
and are in use by the example applications that define a command station.

Every C++ object will be wrapped in the namespace dcc.

namespace dcc {

}  // namespace dcc
