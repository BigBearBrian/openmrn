/** A synchronization primitive for device drivers, where execution has to
 * happen in an interrupt context and on regular contexts. Helpful to implement
 * read() and write() calls contending for a single hardware instance / ring
 * buffer queueing inbound and outbound data. Supports the following features:
 *
 * - Execution on a single regular context when multiple threads might be
 *   contending for this lock.
 *
 * - Execution on a single regular context with interrupts disabled.
 *
 * - Blocking a regular context until data is available.
 *
 * - Waking up a regular context from an interrupt.
 *
 * - Registering a Notifiable to be called when a regular context would be
 *   woken up.
 *
 * Critical should be an object (possibly with no member variables for zero
 * size) that has the following functions:
 * - void lock() to prevent execution of the given interrupt
 * - void unlock() to allow execution of the given interrupt
 * - a one-argument constructor or copy constructor.
 *
 * In some cases, Atomic is a good candidate for Critical.
